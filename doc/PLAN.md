#### Examples

You need to put blank lines to write some text

in separate paragraphs.


Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.


You can also make lists:
* Bullets are made with asterisks
1. You can order things with numbers.

## Interesting Breakout Variants

 * Idea #1

I found the Brick Breaker Hero game very interesting because it's different from the other games in the sense that there is an enemy that you have to defeat that can move around and is defended by different obstacles. The boss also can defend himself.
 * Idea #2

Fairy Treasure stuck out to me because in this game, you can clearly see how the ball reflects depending on where it hits the paddle. Also, the sound that the game makes when the ball hits the blocks is very satisfiying and I believe the way that the ball can hit multiple blocks by reflecting off of different blocks is also an aspect I'd like to have in my version as well.


## Paddle Ideas

 * Idea #1

The ball will bounce depending on which part of the paddle it hits, the middle third causes the ball to bounce perpendicularly to the paddle, the left thirs reflects the ball to the left side(20 degrees) and the right third makes the ball reflect to the right(20 degrees).


 * Idea #2

The paddle will be able to move forward, backwards -to a certain extent- and left and right- from the left side of the screen to the right. 

## Block Ideas

 * Idea #1

The blocks will take multiple hits before getting destroyed. This number will depend on the size of the blocks.

 * Idea #2

Some bigger blocks, when destroyed, will lead to a button falling down. If the paddle is able to touch this button, a certain number of points will be added to the players score.

 * Idea #3

Unless a block is on its last hit, the ball will reflect off of the blocks, and there is a possibilty of hitting multiple blocks in one go.


## Power-up Ideas

 * Idea #1

This power up gives the player the abilty to shoot at the blocks. The gun is in the middle of the paddle
 * Idea #2

This power up increases the length of the paddle. 
 * Idea #3

This power up can either slow down the movemement of the paddle or increase it. The chances of the power up leading to a speedup will be more than a slowdown.
## Cheat Key Ideas

 * Idea #1

This cheat allows the player to shoot a ball that will destroy every block in its path.
 * Idea #2

This cheat code gives the player one extra life

 * Idea #3

This cheat code will allow the player to fire multiple balls at once. Only one of these balls need to be in the user's screen for the user to not lose a life.
 * Idea #4

This cheat code adds a certain number of points to the player's score
## Level Descriptions

 * Idea #1
 
The numbers indicate the sizes of the blocks.
(Random ordering)

1 1 0 3 1 1

1 0 5 0 1 1 

1 0 3 0 0 1

4 0 0 4 0 1

0 1 0 3 1 0

3 0 4 0 1 0

0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0

 * Idea #2

(Alpha shape ordering, with smaller size of paddle, more powerups)

 * Idea #3

(Another pattern, with the negative power up and more obstacles.)
