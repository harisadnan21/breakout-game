### Impressions
This assignement was my first time building a game from scratch and using JavaFX. I learnt many things along the way, the most important of which are how to structure classes, how to make and use functions any way you'd want. This assignment gave us the leeway with what we want to do with it, which I really appreciated, since this is the fist CS project Ive worked on that has this feature. Albeit extremely time consuming, I did learn many things I didnt know before.
